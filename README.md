# Bike Sharing Demand Prediction

## Overview
This repository hosts a machine learning project focused on predicting bike sharing demand. Bike sharing systems are gaining popularity in urban areas as a sustainable mode of transportation. Predicting the demand for bikes helps operators optimize inventory and anticipate usage patterns, improving service efficiency and customer satisfaction.

## Key Features
- **Dataset Exploration**: Analyzed historical bike usage data to understand patterns and trends.
- **Feature Engineering**: Engineered features such as weather conditions, day of the week, and holidays to enhance model accuracy.
- **Model Development**: Built and compared several machine learning models, including linear regression, decision trees, and ensemble methods, to predict bike rental demand.
- **Evaluation**: Evaluated models using metrics like mean squared error (MSE) and R-squared to assess performance and reliability.
- **Deployment**: Implemented the best-performing model into a production environment for real-time predictions.

## Technologies Used
- **Python**: Leveraged Python for data preprocessing, exploratory data analysis, and model development.
- **Scikit-learn**: Used Scikit-learn library for machine learning algorithms, model evaluation, and feature engineering.
- **Jupyter Notebook**: Utilized Jupyter notebooks for interactive development and documentation of the analysis and model training process.
