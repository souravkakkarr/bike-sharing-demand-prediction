# **Bike Sharing Demand Prediction**🚲📈

Pedal into the future with our Bike Sharing Demand Prediction project! 🌤️ This project employs advanced predictive modeling techniques to forecast daily bike demand, incorporating weather conditions, seasonal trends, and holiday patterns.

## Key Features 📈
- **Predictive Modeling:** Developed a robust model using linear regression to accurately forecast bike demand.
- **Achieved Accuracy:** Achieved an impressive accuracy rate exceeding 80% through meticulous training and model refinement.
- **Advanced Techniques:** Implemented advanced techniques like recursive feature elimination and variance inflation factor analysis to streamline the model, reducing feature dimensionality from 28 to 7 and enhancing time complexity.

## Technologies Used 💻
- **Python:** Utilized Python for data preprocessing, model development, and evaluation.
- **Linear Regression:** Employed linear regression for its interpretability and effectiveness in predicting continuous outcomes.
- **Jupyter Notebooks:** Explored and documented insights from data analysis and model training in interactive notebooks.
